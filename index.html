                <h2>Heyyyy snehaaawwww...üëÄ</h2>
       <p>As the new year is just a few hours away I want to share something with you. You‚Äôre someone I met accidentally, but it turned out to be a truly beautiful connection. You‚Äôve always had a personality opposite to mine, yet I‚Äôve thoroughly enjoyed every conversation we‚Äôve had.I still remember the day you wished me on my birthday. You were the first person to do so this year, and that was completely unexpected.Honestly, it made me so happy, and you truly made my day special by just remembering.If at any point, my words have ever hurt you I want to sincerely apologize. Sometimes, I get too comfortable with the people I consider my own, and in doing so, I might say things without realizing they could affect you. Please know it was never intentional, and I‚Äôm truly sorry for any discomfort I caused.As we step into the new year, let‚Äôs leave behind anything that made us feel low and focus on starting fresh. I know you sometimes feel down, but I believe you‚Äôre stronger than you think. Stay happy, keep smiling, and always remember how amazing you are rawww
Finally wishing you a beautiful year ahead snehawwwwwwwww üåùüíó</p>
